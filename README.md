# Mixed-Semi-Supervised-Regression
This repository is related to the paper 'Mixed Semi-Supervised Generalized-Linear-Regression with Applications to Deep-Learning and Interpolators' by Yuval and Rosset (2024), https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2302.09526.

The repository includes simulation code, facilitating the replication of the empirical study detailed in the paper.


Every code file within the directories 'OLS', 'GLM', and 'Linear interpolator' produces the corresponding figure featured in the paper (Figure 1 to 6).



Access to CelebA dataset (available at https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) is required in order to generate Figure 7. Follow 


The datasets for Figures 8 and 9 are included indise the folder 'Interpolating NNs'. The file "Netflix_X_Vote.csv" contains the ratings of 12,931 users that rated the movie "Miss Congeniality", for the 184 movies with the minimal number of missing values among the full Netflix dataset. The file "Netflix_y.csv" contains the ratings of the movie "Miss Congeniality" for the same users. The full Netflix dataset is available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data.
